# Final-Capstone-Team-Main

PHL6 - Orange - Final Capstone 

Worked with four other cohort mates to create a fullstack website using C#, Microsoft SQL Server, Restful APIs, and Vue.JS. We used agile methodology by meeting with a product owner every two days for two weeks to discuss what was done in the previous sprint and what we hoped to accomplish in the next sprint. The website was designed to teach users about the stock market. A user could create a game with one or more other users, where each person buys and sells a stock to make a profit. The game has a set time length and whichever person had the highest portfolio at the end is the winner. 

We divided the work up into pair programming and the part of the project I worked on was assisting with the backend code by using the DAO pattern and restsharp to put the information of the user when logging in, buying a stock, selling a stock, and creating a game was saved into the SQL database and the user could retrieve the game information when they requested it. We used parameterized sql queries, a third party web API to retrive a stock price, JSON for security, and Model-View-Controller pattern.
